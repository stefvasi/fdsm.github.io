The project is inspired by the sensory system of the octopus, hence borrowing its name from this magnificent, highly intelligent creature. Each leg of the Octopus is capable of different sensory modalities including touch, taste, smell and chemical analysis.

After a successful application the project acquired grant from <a href="https://en.rannis.is/funding/research/icelandic-student-innovation-fund/">Rannis</a> -the Icelandic Centre for Research- and will be realised in collaboration with the PhD researcher <a href="http://crozzoli.com/">Miguel Angel Crozzoli</a> and the Intelligent Instruments Lab at the
University of Iceland. The goal of this research project is  the design and development of a software/hardware interface that helps connect
data with physical exploration, by mapping the data into a physical artifact that can be sculpted into
different geometries enabling an embodied multi-sensory experience.
<br>
<br>
The project investigates the potential emergence of knowledge by positioning data navigation through
space, sound, vibrations, textures, and temperature variations to represent changes in EEG data for different
case study. The main goal is to understand brain data structures through interactive exploration.
The aim is to contribute to the emerging field of Data-Human Interaction which is increasingly becoming
more important in our data-driven world, with greater access to data and the societal call for
accessibility in the age of information chaos, providing for an efficient tool for the Experimental
Humanities.
