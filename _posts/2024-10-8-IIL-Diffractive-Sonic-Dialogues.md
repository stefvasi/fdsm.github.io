The Intelligent Instruments Lab is bringing some of the instruments it has been developing to Mengi for an evening of performative sonic explorations. Short pre-composed pieces are followed by improvised sets in which the players are chosen at random by drawing names out of a hat. Impromptu sets respond to prepared performances, instigating a sonic dialogue in which difference and unpredictability require us to carefully listen to one another. The halldorophone, Stacco, the Living Looper, the Sophtar, the EMF Sniffers and more instruments will be played by a rotating group of performers, each bringing a different perspective on what happens when people and their sonic tools find each other on stage.
