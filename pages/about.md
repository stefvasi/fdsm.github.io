dMy diverse background spans multiple disciplines, reflecting my interests as an artist, musician, and researcher. I had a strong affection for music since I was 8 years old: my musical education began with classical guitar studies at the Conservatory “Alex Tournaissen”. I earned a BSc in Applied Mathematics and Physics at the National Technical University of Athens. From 2009 to 2018, I dived into literature and writing under the mentorship of the poet and writer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evgenios_Aranitsis">
Evgenios Aranitsis</a>, working as his personal assistant and editor. During this time, I published in literature magazines, reviews, and newspapers, while also translating works by William Burroughs, Roland Barthes, and Zbigniew Herbert into Greek. I collaborated with publishing houses on books by Nikos Karouzos and Walter Benjamin. Parallel to this work, I performed as a DJ under the aliases ΦΑΝΤΑΣΜΑ ΣΤΗ ΜΗΧΑΝΗ (A Ghost in the Machine) and FDSM. Since 2021, I have curated a bimonthly music selection titled <a herf="https://stegi.radio/artist/stefanos-skialivas">"A Silent Trust"</a> at Stegi Radio.

Returning to academic studies, I attended the Masters Programme ”Music Technology and Contemporary Practices” at the Department of Musical Studies at the National Kapodistrian University of Athens. Currently, I work as a research assistant at the <a href="https://iil.is/">Intelligent Instruments Lab</a>, University of Iceland, where I focus on instrument design, new interfaces for musical expression, human-data interaction, and embedded machine learning synthesis technologies. My research interests center on repurposing existing technology for musical applications and sonifying inaudible wavescapes, such as electromagnetic fields and biological signals from medical research. I integrate this research into my musical practice through <a href="https://www.stefanosskialivas.com/performances">solo performances and artistic collaborations</a>.
